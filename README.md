# Dadmax
A hugging robot project for undergraduate capstone. We named it "Dadmax" because the intention was to make a Baymax-like robot but it's a one-handed robot that gives awkward dad hugs at best so... aptly named.

Follow these:

• "comined.py" is the all-in-one script with OpenCV, movement of the motors, and FSR readings.

• "latest.py" is the script with movement of the motors, and FSR readings.

• "camera.py" is the OpenCV facial detection

• "sensordata" is the data to generate a live graph of the FSR readings.

• "Test" folder contains prototype scripts.

• "roboclaw" is the publically available library with slight modifications.
